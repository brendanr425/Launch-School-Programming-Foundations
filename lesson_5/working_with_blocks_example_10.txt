Line 1: 'map' is called on the outer array. 

Lines 1-11: Outer block execution

Line 2: 'map' is called on the block parameter (sub-arrays). 

Lines 2-10: First inner block execution

Lines 3-9: Conditional execution

Lines 3-5: If the current block parameter 'el' is a single-digit integer, it's incremented by 1. 

Lines 5-9: If the current block parameter 'el' is an array, use 'map'. 

Lines 6-8: Second inner block execution

Line 7: The block parameter 'n' (which represents a sub-array) will have each element incremented by 1. 

Outer block return value: [[[2, 3], [4, 5]], [6, 7]]
