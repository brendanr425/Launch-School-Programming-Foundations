Answer: The select method will return a new array that's identical to the original array. 

Explanation: The first expression 'num > 5' will be ignored because it's not the last line of the block. The string 'hi' right below the previous expression will be evaluated for it's truthiness since it's the last line of the block. Since the string alone is a truthy value, every element within the original array will be stored in the new array.
