Answer: The return value of reject will be identical to the array it was called on. 

Explanation: 'reject' will return a new array based on the falseness of the block's condition. If the block evaluates to false, the current element will be included in the new array. Since puts will always return nil (a 'falsy' value) none of the elements will be excluded because integers by themselves always evaluate to true. (true == false => false)
