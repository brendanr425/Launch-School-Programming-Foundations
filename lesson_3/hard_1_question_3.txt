A: 
one is: one
two is: two
three is: three

Explanation: Even though the parameters of mess_with_vars are set equal to different values, the '=' method is non-destructive. Therefore, the function will not affect the values of each variable beyond its scope. 

B: 
one is: one
two is: two
three is: three

Explanation: The results remain the same as the previous code group even though the strings are defined within the function. 

C: 
one is: two
two is: three
three is: one

Explanation: The 'gsub!' method becomes destructive after adding bang operator '!'. Therefore, the function will alter the values of each variable beyond its scope.
